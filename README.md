## Introduction

Stock price prediction is a challenging task due to the inherent volatility and randomness of the stock market. This notebook aims to provide a simple and effective approach to predicting stock prices using a linear regression model. By leveraging historical stock data, the model tries to forecast future prices based on past trends.

## Features

- Data preprocessing and cleaning
- Feature selection and engineering
- Implementation of a linear regression model
- Visualization of predicted vs actual stock prices
- Evaluation of model performance

## Installation

To run this notebook, you need to have Python installed along with several libraries. You can install the required libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib
```

## Usage

1. Clone this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mustafahk27/Stock-Market-Prediction-ML-Model.git
```

2. Navigate to the repository directory:

```bash
cd Stock-Market-Prediction-ML-Model
```

3. Ensure you have the `TCS.xls` file in the repository directory. This file contains the historical stock data used for the prediction model.

4. Open the Jupyter Notebook:

```bash
jupyter notebook "Stock Prediction - ML Linear Regression Model.ipynb"
```

5. Follow the instructions in the notebook to run the cells and observe the results.
